# Parallel Execution

Vibranium utilizes Node JS's event loop to run parallel requests. The maximum number of parallel executors is controlled by two parameters

 - `max_parallel_executors` key in [Config json](../setup/1.5.config_json.md)
 - `--parallel` option in the [Run command](../cli/2.4.vc_r.md)


The bigger the number, the more parallel executors Vibranium spawns. But as with most cases, the effects will reduce after a certain number. It is usually recommended to keep this value based on the number of cores and threads in your system CPU. For example, for a hexacore CPU with two threads each, it is recommended to use 12.

> If you want all the endpoints to run synchronously, you can select the number of executors to be 1.

Also, if you want to run certain endpoints synchronously, then you can use the `async` option in those endpoint objects.
