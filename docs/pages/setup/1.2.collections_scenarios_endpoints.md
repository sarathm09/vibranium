Like mentioned in the previous section, if I have my workspace at `˜/workspace` and my tests directory is named `Vibranum-Tests`, then I'll have a directory structure 

```shell
˜/
  workspace/
    config.json
    jobs/
      latest/
      job_n/
    logs/
    Vibranium-Tests/
      scenarios/
      payloads/
      schemas/
      templates/
      docs/
```
