# Configure Vibranium

This step initialises Vibranium configurations. Open Command Line/ Terminal and change the directory to the directory that you with to make as your workspace and run the following command and enter the answers to the questions that follow

```shell
vc setup
```

> Make sure you navigate to the workspace directory before running this command as it sets the current working directory as the workspace.

### Example:

```shell
cd ˜  
mkdir workspace
cd  workspace

vc setup
                                         
Please enter your user id: sarathm09
Please enter your email id: some.email@domain.com
Please enter your name: VibraniumTester
```

This step basically register the current working directory as the workspace in the internal Vibranium configuration, and creates the inital set of directories like `jobs` and `logs`. 



## Clone test cases

If you have test cases already available, you'll have to clone the test cases into the workspace

```shell
cd ˜/workspace
git clone https://github.com/someUser/Vibranium-Tests.git
```
