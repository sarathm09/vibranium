```shell
❯ vc r -h                                
Usage: vc run|r [options]

Run the Vibranium tests

Options:
  -c --collections [collections]            Collections to run, separated by comma(,) (default: "all")
  -s --scenarios [scenarios]                Scenarios to run, separated by comma(,) (default: "all")
  -a --apis [apis]                          API endpoints to run, separated by comma(,) (default: "all")
  -l --log [loglevel]                       Logging level [info, debug, error, minimal] (default: "info")
  -r --report [reportType]                  Generate reports for the execution. Values can be any of junit, csv
                                            and json (default: "json")
  -p --parallel [number_of_parallel_tasks]  Number of parallel tasks. Default is 10
  -v --variables [variables]                Variables to be used for executions. usage:
                                            var1=value1,var2=value2...
  --cred [cred]                             Credentials provided in base64 format
  --sync                                    Run endpoints in synchronous mode
  --system [systems]                        The system on which the apis need to be executed. The sytem name
                                            should be defined in the config file
  --no-color                                Plain text output without colors

While running tests, you can specify to run either all tests (not specifying any filters) or select a set of collections, scenarios or apis to be executed, using the `-c`, `-s` or the `-a` options.


## Logger options

You can specify the logging level while running tests using the `--log` option. The possible values are `info`, `debug`, `error`, `minimal`. The first three are the usual logging levels. minimal refers to showing minimal logs, with only the endpoint name and it's status in the output.

Irrespective of the logger option you choose, all logs will be saved to a file in the logs directory inside your workspace.

## Validating scenarios
Use the `--validate` option to validate your scenario files and check if they comply to to the schema.

## Reporting

Vibranium reports can be of type junit, csv, json and html. The default reporting type is json and you can specify multiple types separated by comma. All the reports will be saved to the jobs directory inside the workspace. the same reports will be available in both jobs/jobname as well as jobs/latest.

## Parallel execution

You can specify the number of parallel executions by using the `--parallel` option.

## Multi System execution

The `--system` option is used to specify the system in which you want the execution to happen. If you want to specify the default system that you have specified in the `config.json` file, you just need to specify the new system name as `default=newSystemName`

## Silent

This is an option to avoid all logs and print only the response of the endpoints specified.
