# Systems

A `system` is a very loosely defined term in Vibranium. It can refer to different landscapes, applications, accounts, tenants etc.

For example, If we have a dev landscape with three tenants, each having two users that are used for testing, then if we want to use them in Vibranium, it becomes six accounts, as follows:

  1. **dev_tenant1_user1** : user1 credentials in dev tenant1 
  2. **dev_tenant1_user2** : user2 credentials in dev tenant1 
  3. **dev_tenant2_user1** : user1 credentials in dev tenant2 
  4. **dev_tenant2_user2** : user2 credentials in dev tenant2 
  5. **dev_tenant3_user1** : user1 credentials in dev tenant3 
  6. **dev_tenant3_user2** : user2 credentials in dev tenant3 

A better way to visualize this is using the JSON structure in `config.json`

```json
{
    "dev_tenant1_read_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant1.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant1.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "readAccessUserName",
            "password": "readAccessUserPassword"
        }
    },
    "dev_tenant1_write_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant1.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant1.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "writeAccessUserName",
            "password": "writeAccessUserPassword"
        }
    },
    "dev_tenant1_read_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant2.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant2.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "readAccessUserName",
            "password": "readAccessUserPassword"
        }
    },
    "dev_tenant1_write_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant2.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant2.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "writeAccessUserName",
            "password": "writeAccessUserPassword"
        }
    },
    "dev_tenant1_read_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant3.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant3.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "readAccessUserName",
            "password": "readAccessUserPassword"
        }
    },
    "dev_tenant1_write_access_user": {
        "url": "https://dev.tenant3.domain.com/ui",
        "api_url": "https://dev.tenant3.domain.com/api/v1",
        "method": "basic",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "writeAccessUserName",
            "password": "writeAccessUserPassword"
        }
    }
}
```
This configuration is maintained in the [Config file](../setup/1.5.config_json.md)
To set one of these systems as the default, all you need to do is add the system name to the config json's `default_account` key.


## Usage

Once the systems are defined in the `config.json`, to use the systems, you need to use the `system` keyword (If you need to use any system other than the system marked as default).

- If the system is not specified anywhere in endpoint of in execution arguments, the default system is picked up.
- If the system is specified in the execution level, using `--system` option [[Refer here](../cli/2.4.vc_r.md)], then that system is picked up. You can override the default system to say `dev_tenant1_write_access_user` by specifying `--system default=dev_tenant1_write_access_user`
- If the system is specified at the endpoint level, using the `system` key [[Refer here](3.2.endpoint_object.md)], then this takes priority and this system is picked up for execution.

> If in any case the system specified is not found in the config.json, then the default system specified in the config.json is automatically picked up.
